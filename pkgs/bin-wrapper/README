This set of scripts and hooks will trigger pacman to create a wrapper script
for any executable installed under /usr/bin/. The wrapper will be removed when
the executable is removed.

This will allow you to place $JUNEST_HOME/wrappers in your $PATH and use any
JuNest-installed application transparently, including the use of a desktop
launcher.

The wrapper script targets the default (ns) JuNest back-end and will bind to
any locations specified by a $JUNEST_BINDS environment variable, e.g.:

export JUNEST_BINDS="--bind /media /media"

You will have to export $JUNEST_HOME as normal. junest must be on your $PATH.
